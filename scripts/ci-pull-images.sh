# CI only: pulls the images the Compose smoke test needs, with retries, so a
# brief registry error does not fail the job. With scripts/ci-docker-mirror.sh
# run first, each pull goes through mirror.gcr.io with Docker Hub as the
# fallback. The build then takes its base images from the local store.
#
# The images come from the files themselves, so the list stays current:
# - the Dockerfile's `# syntax=` frontend and its FROM images (flags such as
#   --platform and the AS name dropped; a FROM that names an earlier stage,
#   such as `FROM build AS toolstest-build`, is skipped);
# - every `image:` in docker-compose.yml without a variable (an image with a
#   variable, ${PAPERLESS_GO_IMAGE:-…}, is the one Compose builds).
# It fails when it finds no image or a FROM it cannot read (a variable, a line
# continuation), so a new Dockerfile form does not slip by silently.
#
# Usage: scripts/ci-pull-images.sh [--list]   (--list prints the images only)
