You review {{PR_URL}} in pklnx/paperless-go. Review only: no code changes, pushes or merges.
No `gh` in cloud sessions: use the GitHub MCP tools for the same operations.
Specification: the "## Plan" comment on #{{ISSUE}} with reviews and maintainer decisions.

Read `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff` and the changed files in full on branch {{BRANCH}}. Look for: plan fidelity, data loss, crashes, hangs, security/privacy, tests that would fail without the change, time-based waits in tests.
Blocking only per the CLAUDE.md list; everything else is a follow-up. Each finding: file:line, scenario, why, fix. Don't invent problems.

Checks: read CI once with `gh pr checks <n>` (don't watch); locally run the tests of the changed code (`TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://paperless:paperless@localhost:5432/paperless?sslmode=disable go test -race -count=1 ./internal/<pkg>/ -run <filter>`); for a regression test, verify it fails without the fix.

Post one comment: "## Review", "Verdict: approve" / "approve, pending CI" / "changes requested", numbered findings, "## Follow-ups", "## Test report" (head SHA, checks table), `— Claude (<model>), reviewer`. Never start a line with the at-mention of claude.
Report: verdict, findings, follow-ups, checks.
